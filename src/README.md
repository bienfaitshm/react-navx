# NavX -- MobX-State-Tree and React Navigation integration

NavX aims to provide a simple abstraction over React Navigation and MobX-State-Tree.

NavX is a working name. There's already an NPM package by that name (naturally), so we may change it in the future.

## Implicit Dependencies

- React Native
- React Navigation 3+
- MobX 5+
- MobX-State-Tree 3+
- MobX-React 6+
- AsyncStorage
